# Solving Pig Latin with Java

The rules of Pig Latin are as follows:
1.	For words that begin with consonants, all letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word sequence. Then, "ay" is added
-	Pig =  igpay
-	Latin = atinlay
-	Cat = atcat
-	Dog = ogday
-	Rabbit = abbitray
-	Fudge = udgefay
-	Razer = azerray
-	Smile = ilesmay
-	Stupid = upidstay
2.	If a word starts with a vowel just add “yay” at the end of each word:
-	Apple = appleyay
-	Empty = emptyyay
-	Arrow = arrowyay
-	Under = underyay
-	Over = overyay

You should be able to do this using two functions, one which translates a word and one that translates a sentence.

Note that a user should be able to translate a single word but also a full sentence. 

Finally – when printing out the results, the first word of a sentence should be capitalised.

(please note a user could put special characters within such as full stops and question marks so handle these too 😊
